## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was good practice for laying out pages using both grid and flex box.


### Continued development

I am still struggling with pixel perfection, I will do a few more of the easier challenges to get this down before moving to React.
